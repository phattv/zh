# Changelog

## 2026-06-11

- feat(search): add "Report missing word" button on no-results state — sends query to Slack and logs to Vercel
- build(data): add `make missing word={word}` command — enriches a single word via Claude Haiku (pinyin, en, vi, sino_vi, types, HSK 2.0 level), appends to `hsk-enriched.json`, regenerates `words.ts`, and records with timestamp to `scripts/data/added-words.json`
- feat(learn): pre-generate word enrichment (explanation, examples, synonyms, antonyms) via offline Claude Haiku pipeline — learn page reads from static `enrichments.ts` instantly with no runtime API call
- - build(data): add `scripts/enrich-learn.mjs` (resume-safe, batched) and `scripts/generate-enrichments-ts.mjs`; add `make enrich-learn`, `make generate-enrichments`, `make learn-pipeline`

## 2026-06-10

- feat(learn): add /learn page with HSK level + topic browse, randomize button, and word detail view
- feat(learn): add `/api/learn/enrich` route — AI enrichment (synonyms, antonyms, example sentences, explanation in Chinese) via Claude Haiku, cached per word in session
- feat(learn): synonyms, antonyms, compounds, and "More HSK N" suggestions are tappable for word-to-word navigation
- feat(search): tap Chinese character in word cards navigates to /learn word detail
- revert(search): add, then remove ZH/EN/VI keyboard language chips — web browsers cannot trigger the native IME language picker (`InputMethodManager` is Android-only); `lang` attribute hint ignored by Gboard/Chrome

## 2026-06-08

- feat(write): add /write page with Analyze mode (grammar corrections + bilingual explanations, vocabulary upgrades, original vs corrected diff) and Develop mode (develop · longer · shorter · simpler · richer · HSK 1–6 transforms with character-level diff)
- feat(write): add `/write/analyze` and `/write/develop` API routes backed by Claude Haiku

---

## 2026-06-07

- refactor(lib): extract `segmentText` and `splitSentences` to `src/lib/segment.ts` (shared by both sub-tabs)
